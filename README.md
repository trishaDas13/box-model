The "div" tag in HTML functions as a versatile container, allowing grouping of content elements for styling and layout purposes. It aids in structuring and organizing components within web pages. Its attributes can be utilized with CSS and JavaScript for enhanced design and interactivity.

width: 96%;
I've set the width of the element with the class container to 96% of its containing element's width. This width percentage ensures that the container takes up a large portion of the available horizontal space.

border: 2px solid red;
I've added a border to the element with the class container. The border is 2 pixels wide and has a solid red color. This creates a visible boundary around the container, helping to visually separate it from other content.

margin: 2%;
I've added a margin of 2% to the element with the class container. This margin creates space around the container, preventing it from being too close to other elements. The margin contributes to the overall spacing and layout of the content on the page.

"h1" tag:
The "h1" tag defines the highest-level heading, usually the main title of a webpage, conveying its primary content.

"p" tag:
The "p" tag represents a paragraph of text, structuring and separating content for readability and comprehension.

For h1 and p elements:

border: 2px solid red;
I've added a 2-pixel wide solid red border around both h1 and p elements. This border helps visually separate these elements from the surrounding content, adding a clear distinction.

padding: 0.5%;
I've applied a padding of 0.5% to both h1 and p elements. This padding creates a small space between the content and the border, enhancing readability and appearance.

width: 98%;
I've set the width of both h1 and p elements to 98% of their containing element's width. This width ensures that the content within these elements spans most of the available horizontal space.

margin: auto ;
I've used auto for the left and right margins of both h1 and p elements. This centers the elements horizontally within their containing element, creating a balanced and centered appearance.

margin-top: 3%;
I've added a top margin of 3% to create a comfortable space between these elements and any content above them.

margin-bottom: 2%;
Similarly, I've applied a bottom margin of 2% to create some separation between these elements and any content below them. This contributes to an overall well-spaced layout.

For .div1 and .div2 elements:

width: 98%;
I've set the width of both .div1 and .div2 elements to 98% of their containing element's width. This width ensures that these elements span most of the available horizontal space.

border: 2px solid red;
I've added a 2-pixel wide solid red border around both .div1 and .div2 elements. This border creates a visual distinction for these elements.

margin: auto;
By using auto for the left and right margins of both .div1 and .div2 elements, I'm centering these elements horizontally within their containing element.

padding: 0.5%;
I've applied a padding of 0.5% to both .div1 and .div2 elements. This padding creates a small space between the content and the border, improving the visual appearance.

For li elements:

border: 2px solid red;
I've added a 2-pixel wide solid red border around li elements. This border visually separates list items, making them stand out.

padding: 2%;
I've applied a padding of 2% to li elements. This padding creates space between the content and the border, enhancing the appearance of list items.

For .div2 elements (overrides previous rules):

border: 0;
I've removed the border from .div2 elements, effectively canceling the previous border setting. This is a specific rule for .div2 elements and ensures they don't have a border, providing a different visual treatment compared to other elements.

"a" tag:
The "a" tag creates hyperlinks to other web pages or resources using the "href" attribute.

border: 0;
I've specifically removed the border from elements with the class .p2. This means that elements with this class won't have any visible border around them.
For span and a elements:

border: 2px solid red;
I've added a 2-pixel wide solid red border around both span and a elements. This border creates a visual distinction for these elements, highlighting them with a red border.

padding: 1%;
I've applied a padding of 1% to both span and a elements. This padding creates space between the content and the border, enhancing the visual appearance and readability of these elements.

In summary, .p2 elements won't have any borders, while span and a elements will have red borders and a bit of padding for a clear visual effect.
